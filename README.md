# pnp
Liars' oracles: Relativizing the P vs. NP problem

# Caveats
## Not a proof of independence
Any proof of "independence" as such obviously would require enumerating certain axioms and then showing that "P=NP"
is neither inconsistent nor provable with the given axioms, assuming that the basic axioms themselves are consistent.

## Unsoundness
Given a consistent set of axioms A and any well-formed mathematical statement Q, at least one of Q and ~Q must be consistent
with the original axioms A.

This is not necessarily sound, however.
